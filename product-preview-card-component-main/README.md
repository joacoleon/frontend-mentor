## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This time i took a mobile first approach which made things easier but i struggled to get it to look right when switching to desktop. I learned how to change styles based on screen width and im happy with the result but i think that i probably dont need two media queries.

### Continued development

I feel like i need to structure my css better and dont worry about it until i have most of the layout in place. Also, when i have to use images, i rely on trial and error until it looks somewhat right, but i need to understand what im doing. Lastly, i still need to get better with units, using px that much isnt probably a good idea.
