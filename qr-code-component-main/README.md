## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

At first i struggled to get it to look right in mobile, so i started messing around with media queries, which im not too familiar with. Now i realize i should have taken a mobile first approach and get the html structure first, then move onto the css.

### Continued development

I think i need to get more familiar with CSS units and practicing more how to get something to look as requested in desktop and mobile.
